### Description
This is a backend implementation of a Crop Monitoring Management System using the Spring Framework and other Java-based technologies. The API provides endpoints to manage crops, fields, equipment, staff, vehicles, and monitoring logs. The project is built using Spring Boot for RESTful services, Hibernate for database interaction, and MySQL as the database. Lombok is used to reduce boilerplate code

### Technologies Used

- Spring Framework (Web MVC): Backend framework for building RESTFULL services.
- Hibernate: ORM (Object Relational Mapping) for database interaction.
- Spring Data JPA: Data repository abstraction layer for database operations.
- MySQL: Relational database used for storing POS data.
- Lombok: Used to reduce boilerplate code (getters/setters, constructors) and implement logging using SLF4J.
- SLF4J: Simple Logging Facade for Java used for logging and debugging purposes.
